    First you need to fork your own version of the repository. Then a TL is added as a collaborator to the project. 
    Afterwards you need to clone the repository by copying the github url. Open the terminal and cd into your desired project directory. 
    Run **$ git clone url** then hit enter. Then you have to cd into directory of git project. Now you have to create your own 
    branch for the project by typing: **$ git checkout -b ‘firstname-lastname’**. Then you can begin working on your project. Once changes 
    have been made on your branch, you will have to add the changes to repository. This is done with **$ git add filename**. Alternatively, 
    you can add all files by typing **$ git add . **. Then a commit has to be made to save changes. Included in the commit needs to be a message 
    describing what work was done. The command for committing with a message is: **git committ -m "descriptive message of what was done". After 
    the commit you will need to push to the repository. This is done with the **$ git push -u origin branch-name** command. After the 
    add/commit/push is completed you will need to do a pull request on github. Click on pull request, change base repository branch to your branch, 
    compare the base to your branch and add your TL to reviewer. Finally create the pull request.


Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    An inline element does not take up a new line. It only takes up as much width as needed. A block line element. A block level element 
    starts on a new line and takes up the entire width of the line. A new line is displayed before and after the element with block level.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

    When an element is positioned absolutely it will overlap elements, overriding basic document flow behavior. It will sit in its own layer 
    separate from everything. This can be useful for 'floating' elements on the page.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    Add a **display: inline;** property to it in CSS.

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display 
    inline-block by default

    Three Default 'Block-Level' Elements
        1. <address>
        2. <p>
        3. <nav>
    
    Two Default 'Inline' Elements
        1. <a>
        2. <span>

    One Default 'Inline-Block' Elements
        1. <img>  

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements 
    respect the width we've given them? 

    The box model in CSS is a 'box' that wraps around every element. It consists of a margin, a border, its padding and its content area. 
    The "fix" for the box model is with the box-sizing css property being set to **border-box**. This will make all elements within it respect
    the width given to it.
